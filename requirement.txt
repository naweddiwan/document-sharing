Design and implement a Simple document Service where users can create documents and read the same.
A document has a name and associated string content. Document=> <name{string}, content{string}>

All documents are private when created.
Owners of documents can {grant} {read OR edit} access to other users
Only the owner can delete a document
Username will be just a string. Every action like create/read/edit/delete must be made on behalf of a user



Class: document -> 
	Data members: id, name, content, ownerid
			 Map<User, Role> // users with their access levels
Class: User ->
Data member: id, name, 
//Map<Document, > // documents with the access level user has.

Methods:  createDoc(), delete(), edit(), read(), grantAccess()

Class: AccessControl ->
	Methods: checkForAccessControl() // args: document, and user, operation->

Class :Role ->
	Enum roles {
		OWNER,
		EDITOR,
		READER
}

Fixed input.
